# Stagewise implementation of SQPs for OCP

This is the repository that contains the code to generate the benchmarks of [paper]. It includes trajectory optimization scripts and the MPC scipts used in our hardware experiments. 

## Quick Overview of the code

The two main solver variants used in this repository are available in our optimal control solver library [mim_solvers](https://github.com/machines-in-motion/mim_solvers/tree/main) :
1. **Stagewise SQP (SSQP)** : solver that is designed to solve unconstrained optimal control problems quickly. The implementation of the algorithm is in `python/sqp_ocp/solvers/ssqp.py` .
2. **Constrained Stagewise SQP (CSSQP)** : solver that can handle constraints for OCPs by exploiting sparsity.  The implementation of the algorithm is in `python/sqp_ocp/solvers/cssqp.py` .
